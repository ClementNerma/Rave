# SilverNight

SilverNight is a statically-typed multi-platform language. It aims to provide a unique language to make desktop applications, websites, web applications, and so on.
It can be transpiled to JavaScript for the web, to Rust for thread-safe desktop applications and servers, to C++ for applications in need of speed, to Java for multi-platform software and to Swift for the iOS platform.

**Please note this language is not finished yet ; some features could be added, modified or removed at anytime. Be careful about this.**

## Documentation

You can take a look at the language's syntax and its current state by reading [The Hybrid Book](https://silvernight.herokuapp.com/docs/book/hybrid.html).

## Syntax highlighting support

You can install an extension to grant support syntax highlighting to your favorite code editor.

*NOTE :* Only a few code editors are supported for now. You can list them with `yarn available-editors`.

Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClementNerma/SilverNight.git # Download the repository
cd SilverNight # Go to the downloaded folder
yarn # Install dependencies
yarn install-extension <editor> # Run `yarn available-editors` to get the list
```

And follow the instructions that appears in your terminal.
