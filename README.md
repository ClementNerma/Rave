# SilverNight

SilverNight is a statically-typed functional language, designed to unify applications development by using a single language for web, mobile, desktop, server and IoT applications. It can also be compiled to run natively on a given platform or turned into bytecode to run in a dedicated virtual machine.

Currently, SilverNight is only in its early development. Nothing has been validated or frozen for now. The project (including the language and all the resources related to it) may change at any time.
