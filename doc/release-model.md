# Release model

**WARNING:** This document is a draft and is **not** the definitive release model of the project.

## Versioning

Rave follows the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Project's state

Rave is currently in its `alpha` phase, which only consists in writing specifications and documents about the project.
When all is ready, it will move to the `beta` phase, were development will start and the first releases will be made.
When the `1.0` version is reached, and all features work correctly and have been deeply tested, Rave will be stated as `stable`.

## Release process and channels

When a new version is developed, a milestone is created with the list of tasks to perform before the release. When all tasks have been performed (including tests), the version is released in the `nightly` channel for early users. After two weeks, the version is moved to the `stable` channel.
