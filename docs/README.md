# Documentation

The documentation is split in two parts:

* The **books**, which present the language under several aspects ;
* The **API reference**, which is an exhaustive list of all APIs natively available

This folder contains only the books ; the API reference is automatically generated from the libraries located in the `src/libraries` folder.

## List of books

[The Hybrid Book](hybrid.md) is an exhaustive tutorial. It contains many examples and introduce concepts step by step. It is recommanded if you don't know the language yet.

[_The Master Book_](master.md) (not available yet) is an exhaustive tutorial about the toolchain. It notably explains how to compile, interpret or transpile programs, introduce the concept of pre-built archives and frontend libraries. It's an extension of [The Hybrid Book](hybrid.md).

[The Specifications Book](specs.md) contains the specifications of the language. It is very technical as it only aims to provide detailed informations about the language's structure, syntax and features.
